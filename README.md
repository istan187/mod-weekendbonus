# Features
This module will increase the experience, money, reputation, and skill ups gained on weekends (and optionally nights as well). That means Friday from 18:00 (6 PM), Saturday and Sunday (and optionally evenings 18:00 (6 PM) to 00:00 (midnight)). It will announce the start and end of the bonus period.

The multipliers can be changed using the configuration options.
